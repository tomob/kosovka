## Overview 

Kosovka is a small personal project for me to:

* get proficient with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
* learn programming traditional board game engines (like chess).


## Kosovka

*Kos√≥wka* is Polish name for [Pinus mugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_mugo), a species of small pine endemic to European mountains.
